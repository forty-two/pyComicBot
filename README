This is a small IRC bot that creates comics after trigger words are said in the 
channel (defaults to laughter expressions such as 'lol'). It is a port of Paul
Mutton's original comicbot (http://www.jibble.org/comicbot/).

Note that most of the template images are currently from the original comicbot,
therefore they belong to the creators titled in the images.

Dependancies:
    PIL
    IRCLib
